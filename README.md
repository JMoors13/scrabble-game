## Scrabble Game

This is a scrabble game I designed during my university studies. It is a (hopefully) fully functioning game of scrabble that allows each user to place tiles down and shows both players score each turn.

I may possibly come back to this project to add some mnior tweaks and quality of life changes if I get the chance.

# Install

You'll need to be in a unix system to run the files.
(I use wsl to run the program.)
From the root directory, run the makefile command "make all".
This creates the 'scrabble' file which can be run with "./scrabble"
The game will load and you can follow the prompts from there.

(for some reason I don't explain the game upon the first turn, so here are the instructions for how to play)

# How to play:

If you're ever stuck, you can type "help" to see what actions can be played.

For general play, the moves are as follows:

- Place a tile: 'place A at A0
- End your turn and place your word: 'place Done
- Replace a tile from your hand: 'replace A
- Pass your turn to the next player: 'pass'
- Save the game at it's current state with a game name: 'save example'
